## Use Interior Point OPTimizer (IPOPT) with TensorFlow
tf-ipopt does constrained optimization in TensorFlow using IPOPT. Models are defined using TensorFlow variables and operations. Gradients for optimization are computed by TensorFlow and passed on to the IPOPT solver. This allows us to exploit the power of GPUs to speed up numerical optimization. See examples for details on how to model and solve constrained optimization.

Follow the steps to install. It is assumed that
* tensorflow
* [ipopt](https://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/)
* [pip ](https://github.com/xuy/pyipopt)

are already installed. Details on how to install ipopt and pyipopt will be added later.

#### Step 1
We define a new class `IpoptOptimizerInterface` that can be used very much like `ScipyOptimizerInterface`. Make the following two changes in the `external_optimizer.py` in tensorflow package located at `tensorflow/contrib/opt/python/training/`.  

Allow import of the new `IpoptOptimizerInterface` class.
```
__all__ = ['ExternalOptimizerInterface', 'ScipyOptimizerInterface', 'IpoptOptimizerInterface']
```

#### Step 2
Second, **copy** the class definition from the file `ipopt_optimizer.py` to `external_optimizer.py`.

#### Step 3
Modify `_allowed_symbols` to add `IpoptOptimizerInterface` in `__init__.py` located at `tensorflow/contrib/opt/`

```
_allowed_symbols = [
    'PowerSignOptimizer',
    'AddSignOptimizer'
    'DelayCompensatedGradientDescentOptimizer',
    'DropStaleGradientOptimizer',
    'ExternalOptimizerInterface',
    'LazyAdamOptimizer',
    'NadamOptimizer',
    'MovingAverageOptimizer',
    'ScipyOptimizerInterface',
    'IpoptOptimizerInterface',
    'VariableClippingOptimizer',
    'MultitaskOptimizerWrapper',
    'clip_gradients_by_global_norm',
    'ElasticAverageOptimizer',
    'ElasticAverageCustomGetter'
]
```

That's it! Check examples for details on how to use IpoptOptimizerInterface.
